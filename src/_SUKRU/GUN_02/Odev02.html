<br>
<p>Dear Eileen,

<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science
    faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one,
    in the following sections.
<p>Starting dates: 1 Sep 2020, 1 Oct 2020
<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
    however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester;
    the start dates for each one are as follows:
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp• First semester: 9 September 2016<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp• Second semester: 15 January 2017<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp• Third semester: 2 May 2017<br>

<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
<p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website.</p>
